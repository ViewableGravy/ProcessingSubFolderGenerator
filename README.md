# ProcessingSubFolderGenerator
Processing does not allow subfolders for pde files, and using eclipse adds bloat to your code, this bit of python code attempts to avoid this by taking your processing project folder and making deep copies of each file in another folder. This allows you to edit your code from an editor (such as vsCode) and have a structured folder system, while still having a working project. Note that this solution will also search for files you add to your folder structure that are not in the original folder and will transfer them into it, so you can comfortably make new classes and easily transfer them into your main sketch folder
